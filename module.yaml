# This is an example of module.
#
# A module is basically a group of steps.
#
# The module.yaml file goes through a templating engine first before getting parsed. So some variables are available:
#
# - {{ .Job }} and its childs, which represent the Job object using the module. Can be useful if you want to dynamically set an value based on the job.
# - {{ .Step }} and its childs, which represent the Step object using the module. Can be useful if you want the step name.
#
# To outputs environment variables, just append KEY=value to the "${DEEPSQUARE_ENV}" file.
